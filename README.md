# Thomas Ha — Frontend-Focused Full-Stack Engineer

I build **clean, responsive, user-centered** web experiences with modern **React + TypeScript** ecosystems.  
Frontend is my core lane (UI architecture, state management, performance), and I’m comfortable owning the full pipeline when needed—APIs, databases, and deployment.

📍 Seattle, WA

## Focus Right Now

- **Frontend Architecture (React/TypeScript):** component structure, reusability, scalability  
- **Performance:** render optimization, memoization strategy, async stability  
- **Production Workflow:** deployment reliability (Nginx/HTTPS/env/CORS/auth pitfalls)

> I care about code that doesn’t just “work,” but **keeps working in production**.

I’m a guitarist focused on blues and jazz fusion.  
It keeps my creativity sharp—and helps me obsess over rhythm and timing (which somehow transfers to UI details).
